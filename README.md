This repository contains a LyX module to facilitate creation of pseudocode listings using the `listings` LaTeX package. It is available under the GPLv3 open-source license.

The current (beta) version is 0.1.

This module is written for LyX file format 66, the current format for LyX 2.3.1. You may be able to use it with (somewhat) older versions of LyX by manually editing the `Format` line in the module. It should be forward compatible with later versions of LyX.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome, using the issue tracker for the repository.

Key files:
* pseudolst.module (the module itself)
* pseudolst.lyx (a user's guide)
